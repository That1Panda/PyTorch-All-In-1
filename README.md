# PyTorch-All-In-1

This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks where Iâ€™ve implemented the exercises and examples from the **["PyTorch Pocket Reference"](https://www.amazon.com/PyTorch-Pocket-Reference-Building-Deploying/dp/149209000X)** book. The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with PyTorch and explore its various capabilities, from basic tensor operations to advanced topics like distributed training, quantization, and model deployment.

By working through the book and implementing all of its codes, I've covered a wide range of PyTorch functionalities, enabling me to build, optimize, and deploy machine learning models in different contexts.
